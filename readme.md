## Overview

- Headers are used to organise long pages for ease of use and viewing. The upper blocks are separated and the user can switch between them by tabs. This table of contents acts as a zoom-in to the block, rather than a scroll within the page.
  1. Display of the hierarchy or the TOC (tabs)
  2. Separation of the upper blocks in the page
 
 ### TODO

1. [x] Ported TOC functionality
1. [x] Currently, it is implemented in a pop-up display.
1. [ ] I would like to design it in such a way that it switches in tabs.
