# Logseq Plugin: Tabbed Headers for Page Content (TOC)

- Turn the header of the page content into a tab. This allows the page to be divided into separate pages, separated by headers!

## Overview

- Headers are used to organise long pages for ease of use and viewing. The upper blocks are separated and the user can switch between them by tabs.
  1. display of the upper TOC (tabs)
  2. separation of the upper blocks in the page
 
- Ported TOC functionality. Currently, it is implemented in a pop-up display. I would like to design it in such a way that it switches in tabs.
